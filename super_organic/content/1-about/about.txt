New Zealand is recognised around the world for the quality of its food products, and Super Organic Dairy Companyâ€™s New Zealand investments will enhance this reputation.  
 
A change of land usage is required in New Zealand as traditional dairying is reaching its environmental limits. Sheep Milk dairying offers a high value product with a lower environmental impact.
 
Super Organic is focused on developing the New Zealand Sheep milking industry from the ground up. We see bright long-term future for Sheep Dairy industry in New Zealand.
