Super Organic identified that without improving New Zealandâ€™s sheep dairy genetics, it would be impossible to develop a strong sheep dairy industry in New Zealand.   In 2015 Southern Cross Sheep Dairy Technology Company was set up to develop the following:
- Long-term sheep dairy genetics program.
- Sheep dairy farming systems suited for the New Zealand farming environment.
 
In its short history Southern Cross is fast becoming the New Zealand market leader in Sheep Dairy Genetics, which will drive the growth of the entire sheep dairy industry.  
 
Southern Cross has been able to secure the only pure East Friesian dairy sheep genetics (embryos & seamen) available in New Zealand.  Pure East Friesian (and F1 Cross) lambs where successfully born in late 2015, and this has given Southern Cross a strong nucleus flock to develop a large-scale sheep dairy genetics program.
